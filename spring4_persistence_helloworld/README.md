# Hibernate Relationship

## One-2-Many

There are two types of one-to-many association:

**Unidirectional:** In this type of association, only source entity has a relationship field that refers to the target entity. We can navigate this type of association from one side.

**Bidirectional:** In this type of association, each entity (i.e. source and target) has a relationship field that refers to each other. We can navigate this type of association from both sides.
